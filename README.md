## Contributor Rules

**No secrets in the repository**
No passwords, keys, secrets of any sort. Nothing should be sensitive.
Use parameters instead!

**No client information**
Try not to use client names, or specific detail related to clients in scripts.
Make the usage generic or use parameters if possible! 

## Code and Content
The preference is all scripts are:
- Powershell for Windows (.ps1)
- Bash for MacOS (.bash)

Windows Command (.bat) files are also acceptible.

**All Code should include a Synopsis block**

See the [Synopsis template here](https://github.com/andrewbadge/ITAdminScripts/blob/main/Help-and-Usage/Synopsis-Template.ps1)

**Naming**
